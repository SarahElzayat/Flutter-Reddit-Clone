## Descrtiption

Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website. Registered users submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members.

### Motivation

As part of studying software engineering and applying software engineering processes, a large team of 21 people were required to build a social media application clone, for this specific project, Reddit was the one.

A team of 5 people worked on developing a cross platform version of Reddit. 

The cross platform development was mainly based on Flutter framework and Dart programming language.
